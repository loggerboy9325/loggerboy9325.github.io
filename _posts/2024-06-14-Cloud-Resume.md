### About

The Cloud Resume challenge was introduced by Forrest Brazeal and the challenge is a way for people to break into the cloud. Even though I did the cloud resume challenge 2 years ago I felt I should make a updated blog post about it . Below is a diagram of my website architecture ![alt text](/assets/avatar/diagram1.png)\
As you can see its more then just a website. The website is on a CI/CD pipeline and uses Terraform as infrusture as code. It use multiple AWS services including a api that invokes a lambda function that writes to a value to dynamodb table it also returns that value and displays it on my website as a visitor counter.

### Is The Cloud Resume the best beginner project ?  

In my opinion the Cloud Resume challenge is still the best beginner project for anybody that wants to break into the cloud. It not only shows that you know how to use different AWS service but it also shows that you can incorporate a CI/CD pipeline with a  infrusture as Code like Terraform. Its always better to learn more services. Like I stated before the cloud resume project is much more then just a static website hosted by AWS.

### But Will I get a job?

Projects are the best way to showcase your skills especially if you don't have any relevant experience. Theres plenty of testimonials of people saying that the cloud resume challenge helped them get a job. Personally I haven't gotten a job yet but thats honestly my own fault because I haven't put in the work to find a job. I have changed that lately though.

### Conclusion

My conclusion is this to anybody reading. Your success is the amount of work you put in. I know the job market is kinda not good right now but you still have to grind and never give up, and to anyone thinking or in the process of doing this project remember its going to be very beneficial. Imagine telling everyone you have a website. Having a website is very powerful. Its yours you can make it however you want and with the power of the cloud its global.

### Quote

My one friend told me this recently. "You have two choices, you either give up and never get a job, or keep trying and eventually get one."
